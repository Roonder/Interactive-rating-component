## My process

- This was a really nice experience on using the CSS and HTML Forms to build a nice rating component. I took me a while to figure out how to locate properly the buttons, and how to add nice styles on them. It can still be improved, but this was a really good approach, using an only page and swapping the sections using CSS and JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS (https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Pre-processor
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript ES6
- Gulp (https://gulpjs.com/) - Node.js Toolkit
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/es/) - JavaScript Enviroment

### What I learned

I reinforced some basic knowledges in this project, improving on how to use better my CSS and interact properly with the DOM using JavaScript. I'm really proud on the DOM change using the display settings and the function that allows this change.

### Continued development

I plan to use this experience to keep improving my projects using JavaScript to add more functionality to my future projects. Besides of that, it's been a really nice way to keep improving my CSS knowledges, leading me to get better on it and use it with more freedom.

### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to acknowledge to Adan Saavedra's solution. Without his repository I would have taken more time to finish up this project, and it could've been a worst approach on how to set the rating buttons to work. Check out his solution as well and keep learning!
